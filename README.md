- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @carlosenriquezsoto!

I am student at the Universty of Georgia in Athens,Georgia.Go Dawgs! I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am fascinated by all aspects of computer science. I work at Costco Wholesale almost full time where I strive to fulfill the needs of countless members while being knowledgeable about the entire warehouse. I have expierence in:

- Java
- Microsoft Office

When I am not in class or working at Costco, I am working on side projects and learning new skills to develop myself. I truly believe the best way to spend my time is through learning and going through new expierences, and thus in my free time I am learning:

- Python
- SQL 
- German
